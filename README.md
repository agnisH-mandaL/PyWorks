#### This repository contains Python programs that I coded for my learning and application. Some of these might come into use in some tasks.

*Note:* The matrix programs use Gauss-Jordan elimination method for some operations.
- **Inverser 2x2**: This is just used to find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix.
- **Inverser 3x3**: Finds inverse of a 3x3 matrix.
- **Matrix**: Takes input for a 3x3 matrix and performs addition and multiplication operations.
- **Matrix 2.0**: Finds and plots the solution for a system of equations (3x3 matrix) using GUI (Tkinter).
- **Echelon**: Finds the null space and general solution of a system of equation (mxn matrix [m<7]) using GUI.
- **Dice**: Rolls a dice.
- **Newton's Ball**: A 2-D motion simulator; Launches a ball into the sky under the influence of gravity, with velocity and angle of projection as inputs.

Some of these are in still in developement, minor bugs can occur which will be fixed soon.
