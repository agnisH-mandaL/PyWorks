#### This repository contains Python programs that I coded for my learning and application. Some of these might come into use in some tasks.

*Note:* The matrix programs use Gauss-Jordan elimination method for some operations.
- **Inverser 2x2**: This is just used to find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix.
- **Inverser 3x3**: Finds inverse of a 3x3 matrix.
- **Matrix**: Takes input for a 3x3 matrix and performs addition and multiplication operations.
- **Matrix 2.0**: Finds and plots the solution for a system of equations (3x3 matrix) using GUI (Tkinter).
- **Matrix 3.0**: Finds the null space and general solution of a system of equation (mxn matrix [m<7]) using GUI.
- **Dice**: Rolls a dice.

Some of these are in still in developement, minor bugs can occur which will be fixed soon.
