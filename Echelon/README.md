### *Instructions for use:* ###
- Enter the entry value of the matrix row-wise (elements along a row) in the first entry box. Hit ***enter*** button to add an element and ***delete*** to remove the latest element from the entries.
- Enter the number of rows and columns of the matrix (rows only up to 7 is compatible).
- In the second entry box enter the elements for b (RHS element).
- Hit ***equation*** button to pass the values for calculation.
- ***Solve*** button will pass the Null space for the matrix i.e. the linearly independant vectors.
- ***General solution*** will pass the general solution for the matrix.

### *Note: Do not press any button more than once unnecessarily, it would lead to undesirable results on the interface.*
